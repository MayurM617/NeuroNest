# NeuroNest - Cognitive Rehabilitation and Learning Support App

## Project Description
**NeuroNest** is an interactive mobile application designed to support cognitive rehabilitation and learning for individuals with:
- Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
- Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)
- Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

The app delivers engaging, gamified exercises targeting memory, attention, multitasking, and emotional recognition. It offers specialized modes 
for both children and elderly users and includes tools for teachers and caregivers to assist autistic children.

NeuroNest is built using the Flutter framework, supports **offline-first functionality**, and features **adaptive difficulty levels** to personalize 
therapy and learning experiences.


## Features
- 🎮 **Cognitive Games:**
  - **Memory Maze:** Boosts spatial and episodic memory (for ADHD users)
  - **Dual Task Challenge:** Improves multitasking and divided attention (for MCI users)
  - **Emotion Game:** Supports emotional recognition and social learning (for ASD)

- 🗂️ **Learning & Support Tools:**
  - **Routine Builder:** Visual daily scheduling and task management
  - **Communication Board:** Visual communication with Text-to-Speech support
  - **Progress Journal:** Tracks daily activities and performance with charts

- 👩‍🏫 **Teacher Mode:** 
  - Special tools to help teachers and caregivers manage and support autistic children



- 🎯 **Key Highlights:**
  - Adaptive difficulty system based on user performance
  - Minimal distraction UI design for both children and elderly
  - Instant visual and audio feedback
  - Inspired by clinically validated cognitive tasks like the Stroop Test and Trail Making Test
